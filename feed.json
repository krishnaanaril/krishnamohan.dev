Here we are trying a different use case. The use of <code>CancellationToken</code> in <code>MediatR</code> to drop the ongoing request processing. This is very helpful if the request processing is blocked and we want to implement a timeout or if the request is dropped by the initiator.</p>\n<p>For the sample case we will create a web api that try to do a task within 5 seconds. The API method will accept time in milliseconds and if the given time is greater than 5 seconds the task will run for 5 seconds and then get cancelled, otherwise task will be executed for the given time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download\">dotnet core</a></li>\n<li>Install Visual Studio Code/Visual Studio IDE </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"creatingadotnetwebapiapplication\">Creating a dotnet WebAPI application</h2>\n<p>Run the following CLI command to create a WebAPI project.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">dotnet new webapi MediatRSampleAPI\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"configureserilogforloggingoptional\">Configure Serilog for logging (Optional)</h2>\n<p>I'll be using <a href=\"https://serilog.net/\">Serilog</a> and a flat file sink for logging.

            "content_html": "<p>Our organization, as part of common platform initiative, was trying to create an authorization mechanism for multiple applications in our ecosystem. Last week as a part of this initiative I was browsing internet to find a client library that makes use of Attribute based access control (ABAC). <a href=\"https://github.com/topics/abac\">Casbin</a> is one of the most starred libraries in the topic ABAC.\nSo I thought of giving it a try.</p>\n<p>The primary language for Casbin was Go, since it was developed in Go itself. But that wasn't a problem as they've already created similar libraries in java, dotnet and nodejs. I picked <a href=\"https://github.com/casbin/Casbin.NET\">Casbin.Net</a> due to my proficiency in C#. For the sake of simplicity I'm only evaluating Casbin's ABAC feature here. For full feature list please see the <a href=\"https://casbin.org/docs/en/supported-models\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"permmodelinglanguage\">PERM Modeling Language</h2>\n<p>Casbin introduces a new policy language named PERM (Policy, Effect, Request and Matcher) modeling language. If interested you can learn more about it in the author's <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09756\">research paper</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/PERM_MetaModel.svg\" alt=\"PERM Meta Model\" />\n<em>PERM Meta Model</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"request\">Request</h3>\n<p>Request is defined as key-value pair. The key is always r, while the value is a list of attributes. An access request is usually represented by the classic triple: accessing entity (sub), accessed resource (obj) and the access method (act). In this condition, we have: <code>attributes = sub; obj; act</code>, or in PML's grammar: <code>r = sub, obj, act</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"policy\">Policy</h3>\n<p>Policy is defined as key-value pair. The key is always p, which represents an abstract policy rule entity. The value attributes denotes the attribute names that p has. E.g.: <code>p = sub, obj, act</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"policyrule\">Policy Rule</h3>\n<p>Policy rule is an instance of the above policy. The number of elements in the tuple will be identical with the attribute names in policy. For example, the above policy rule: <code>alice, data1, read</code> generates a binding to the attributes like: <code>p.sub = alice, p.obj = data1, p.act = read</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"matcher\">Matcher</h3>\n<p>Matcher determines how the policy rules are evaluated against the request. The simplest matcher is: <code>m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code> (m represents the matcher). It means the matcher returns true only if subject, object and action in the access request exactly match the respective fields in a policy rule.</p>\n<h3 id=\"effect\">Effect</h3>\n<p>The effect primitive determines whether the request should be approved if\nmultiple policy rules match the request. In a effect term, the <strong>quantifier</strong> aggregates the multiple decisions from the valid set for condition into a single boolean value. It can be 'some', 'max' or 'min'. condition functions in a similar way as matcher, but it is used for filtering valid decisions instead of matching the policy rules with the request. E.g: <code>e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\">Examples</h2>\n<p>First we need to create a Casbin enforcer object which accepts two parameters in its constructor. First parameter is <a href=\"https://casbin.org/docs/en/supported-models\">Model</a> and the second one is <a href=\"https://casbin.org/docs/en/adapters\">Adapter</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Model</p>\n<p>Model is defined in a file with .conf extension. A model <code>CONF</code> should have at least four sections: <code>[request_definition], [policy_definition], [policy_effect], [matchers]</code>. If a model uses RBAC, it should also add the <code>[role_definition]</code> section. A model <code>CONF</code> can contain comments. The comments start with <code>#</code>, and <code>#</code> will comment the rest of the line.\nThe matcher evaluation in Casbin is implemented by expression evaluators in each language.</p></li>\n<li><p>Adapter</p>\n<p>In Casbin, the policy storage is implemented as an adapter (aka middleware for Casbin). For full set of supported adapters refer the <a href=\"https://casbin.org/docs/en/adapters#supported-adapters\">documentation</a>. For the examples below I'm using the default file adapter, such that policy rules are defined in csv format.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the full source code in my <a href=\"https://github.com/krishnaanaril/try-outs/tree/master/casbin-poc\">github repository</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"basic\">Basic</h3>\n<p>For the basic example we are just checking whether the subject, object and action attributes of both policy and request match.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>basic_model.conf</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>[request_definition]\nr = sub, obj, act\n\n[policy_definition]\np = sub, obj, act\n\n[policy_effect]\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\n\n[matchers]\nm = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>basic_policy.csv</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>p, alice@example.com, BasicTest, Get\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Verification Code</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"csharp language-csharp\">var e = new Enforcer(\"./casbin-config/basic_model.conf\", \"./casbin-config/basic_policy.csv\");\nif (e.Enforce(sub, obj, act)) \n{\n    // permit alice to read data1\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Access Granted\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // deny the request, show an error\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Access Denied\");\n}    \n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"basicwithenvironmentattribute\">Basic with environment attribute</h3>\n<p>Here we are passing an extra attribute to add policies on environment.

But I'm bit skeptical about its performance in real production environments. To gather some opinions I asked this question in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26112460\">Hacker News</a>, but unfortunately I got reply only from the library's author himself. I had a discussion with our senior architect, who recommended to use the standard <code>XACML</code> for which only some java libraries are available. As a next step, I need to check some libraries based on XACML</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>On that fateful day I was playing around with Youtube API to find a custom algorithm to avoid the default recommendations. All of sudden server errors started popping up for my API requests and for a moment I thought that I broke it. To verify this I logged in to Twitter and it was already trending there.</p>\n<p>There were multiple incidents on that day, but the most important were the Google cloud and Gmail outages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gmailoutage\">Gmail Outage</h2>\n<p>For a period of 6 hours on that day, the service responsible for handling incoming SMTP connections incorrectly responded with an error (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/non-delivery-reports-in-exchange-online/fix-error-code-550-5-1-1-through-5-1-20-in-exchange-online\">hard bounce</a>) to emails being sent to “@gmail.com” users. The error message indicated that the email address did not exist and as a result, the impacted emails were never delivered.</p>\n<p>Email delivery to other email addresses on Google-hosted domains were not affected by this issue and continued to function correctly. SMTP clients conforming to email standards treat error code 550 as a permanent delivery error and do not attempt to resend the email. In response to a permanent delivery error, intermediate SMTP relays send a bounce email back to the original sender, informing them of the delivery error.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rootcause\">Root Cause</h3>\n<p>Google's SMPT inbound service has a configuration system to update flags and service options while deployed in production and ‘@gmail.com’ domain name is specified as one of the configuration options. During an ongoing migration, a configuration change shifted formatting behavior and provided and invalid domain name instead of “@gmail.com”. Due to this service incorrectly transformed lookups of certain email addresses ending in “@gmail.com” into non-existent email addresses resulting in 550 error code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediationprevention\">Remediation &amp; Prevention</h3>\n<p>Upon identifying the root cause, engineering team reverted the code change which resolved the immediate issue. But when they again deployed the same configuration system the next day a similar issue occurred. Formatting error related to “@gmail.com” was identified in the internal logs and they have to again revert it.</p>\n<p>As per the official statement they’ll be taking necessary actions to guard against the issue recurring and to reduce the impact of similar events.\nImpact on Other business</p>\n<p>Most impacted business are the email marketing platforms. Some of them even reported a peak of <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25437340\">90% bounce</a> for almost 24 hours. Since the error code was 550, the email delivery services might’ve started automatically removing, or at least stopping delivery to, a set of email addresses. But on the brighter side, since it’s a known time frame, domain and error response, they can cleanly remove the suppression lists. An error code of 4xx (temporary error) might’ve reduced the impact and I’m not aware of any known side effects for this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"googlecloudoutage\">Google Cloud Outage</h2>\n<p>For a period of 47 minutes on the same day, Google services that required Google OAuth access were unavailable. Cloud service accounts used by GCP workloads were not impacted and continued to function</p>\n<h3 id=\"rootcause-1\">Root cause</h3>\n<p>Google uses an evolving suite of automation tools to manage the quota of various resources allocated for services. As part of an ongoing migration of the User ID Service to a new quota system, a change was made in October to register the User ID Service with the new quota system, but parts of the previous quota system were left in place which incorrectly reported the usage for the User ID Service as 0. An existing grace period on enforcing quota restrictions delayed the impact, which eventually expired, triggering automated quota systems to decrease the quota allowed for the User ID service and triggering this incident. Existing safety checks exist to prevent many unintended quota changes, but at the time they did not cover the scenario of zero reported load for a single service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quota changes to large number of users, since only a single group was the target of the change,</li>\n<li>Lowering quota below usage, since the reported usage was inaccurately being reported as zero,</li>\n<li>Excessive quota reduction to storage systems, since no alert fired during the grace period,</li>\n<li>Low quota, since the difference between usage and quota exceeded the protection limit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, the quota for the account database was reduced, which prevented the <a href=\"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos leader</a> ) from writing. Shortly after, the majority of read operations became outdated which resulted in errors on authentication lookups.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediationprevention-1\">Remediation &amp; Prevention</h3>\n<p>Once the root cause and potential fix were identified, engineers disabled the quota enforcement in one data canter. This quickly improved the situation and later the same mitigation was applied to all data-centres. As per the official statement they’ll be taking necessary actions to guard against the issue recurring and to reduce the impact of similar events.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impactonbusiness\">Impact on business</h3>\n<p>Almost all google services were impacted by this outage. Most services recovered automatically within a short period of time after the main issue ended, but some services like Cloud Console, Google BigQuery and  K8s Engine had unique and lingering impact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//appsstatus/ir/4et50yp2ckm8otv.pdf</li>\n<li>https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20013 </li>\n</ol>",

            "content_html": "<p>In any git workflow, branching and merging code is unavoidable. Here we are having a not-so deeper look at the three important git commands viz. <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge\">git-merge</a>, <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase\">git-rebase</a> and <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect\">git-bisect</a>. At the end you’ll get an idea why certain options and sub-commands exist and its use cases. You can then adapt it to suit your needs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"gitmerge\">Git Merge</h2>\n<p>As the name suggests this command will incorporate changes from named commits/branches to the current branch. <code>git merge topic</code> command will merge topic branch to the current branch. Here topic branch’s <code>HEAD</code> is considered for merge. One thing to note is that, before merge you should commit or stash your uncommitted local changes to avoid confusions during conflict resolution. Also if there are uncommitted changes, <code>git merge --abort</code> in some cases find it difficult to construct the pre-merge state. </p>\n<p>Git merges can be broadly classified into two: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fast Forward Merge</strong>: If there are no changes in the target branch, then source branch is merged without an extra commit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/04_02.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" />\n<em>Fig-01</em></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>True Merge</strong>: If there are changes in source and target branch, then an extra commit is required with both of them as parents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/04_01.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" />\n<em>Fig-02</em></p>\n<p>If there are conflicts in files during merge, we need to manually resolve it. Git will mark conflicts in the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39128500/working-tree-vs-working-directory\">working tree</a>. We should edit the files and stage them. Run <code>git commit</code> or <code>git merge —-continue</code> to complete the merge.</p>\n<p>If you want to drop the merge, then run <code>git merge —-abort</code> or <code>git merge — -quit</code>. The difference between abort and quit is that, abort stops the current merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state while quit leave the index and working-tree as is.</p>\n<p>You can also merge multiple branches as <code>git merge branch1 branch2</code>. The strategy used for this type of merging is <strong><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies#Documentation/merge-strategies.txt-octopus\">Octopus</a></strong> strategy and it refuses to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. So you should make sure that branches in octopus merge touch different files. You can find the different merging strategies <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Want merge changes without a commit? Then use <code>git merge branch1 --squash</code>. This will merge the changes in ‘branch1’ to current branch without any merge information or commit. <code>git log</code> output will look like as if nothing happened.<code>--commit</code> flag is not allowed with this command and will fail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gitrebase\">Git Rebase</h2>\n<p>Rebase too helps in merging branches, but in a different way. Consider <code>git rebase master feature</code> command (short hand for <code>git switch feature</code>, <code>git rebase master</code>), here first all changes in the feature branch will be saved to a temporary area, then feature branch is reset to master branch and saved commits will be replayed one by one on top of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/04_03.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" />\n<em>Fig-03</em></p>\n<p>In case of conflict, rebasing process will be paused and we need to manually fix the conflicts. Once done you can run <code>git rebase --continue</code> to continue the process. To skip a commit, use <code>git rebase --skip</code>. In normal rebasing if the target branch contains merged commits, it will be dropped. We need to pass the option <code>--rebase-merges</code> to avoid this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/04_04.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" />\n<em>Fig-04</em></p>\n<p>One of the powerful option in <code>git rebase</code> is interactive rebasing. It helps user to edit the commits, reorder or even remove them. There are 11 sub-commands that can be used with interactive rebasing, let’s see them one by one. For the purpose of explaining this consider the following branch with a linear history.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/04_05.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" />\n<em>Fig-05</em></p>\n<p>When i run <code>git rebase -i --root</code>, git will open text editor with commits and hints for using sub-commands. Each line will be in the following format: <code>sub-command commit-hash commit-message</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>pick</strong> - this command tells git to use this commit without any modification. e.g: <code>pick 9fadd5a add C</code></li>\n<li><strong>drop</strong> - to drop the commit. All the changes associated with this commit will be dropped. e.g: <code>drop 9fadd5a add C</code></li>\n<li><strong>reword</strong> - this command helps us to change the commit message. During rebasing when this command comes git will open the text editor to enter the new message. Once we enter the new message and saves it rebasing resumes automatically. e.g: <code>reword 9fadd5a add C</code></li>\n<li><strong>squash</strong> - this command helps us to merge the current commit with the previous commit by preserving the commit message. The below command will result in a new commit with message <code>add C add D.</code></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>pick 9fadd5a add C\nsquash b390979 add D\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>fixup</strong> - this is similar to ‘squash’, but discard the commit message. The below command will result in a new commit with message <code>add C</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>pick 9fadd5a add C\nfixup b390979 add D\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>edit</strong> - Consider the scenario, you’ve missed a file during the commit. If it was the last commit we can use <code>git commit --amend</code>, otherwise we’ll use interactive rebase with <code>edit</code>. First we’ll stash the files to be committed, then do a rebase and mark the commit to be edited using edit. e.g: <code>edit 9fadd5a add C</code>. Rebasing halts when it reaches edit command. Here we can pop the stashed changes and run <code>git commit --amend</code> to add the missed files. Once done you can run <code>git rebase --continue</code> to continue rebasing.</li>\n<li><strong>exec</strong> - this command helps us to run a command or script. e.g: <code>exec ‘pwd’</code> will print current working directory during rebasing. This is just dumb example, but the command is really helpful in complex use cases.\neg: <strong>exec 'pwd'</strong> will print current working directory during rebasing. This is just dumb example, but really helpful in complex use cases.</li>\n<li><strong>break</strong> - this command helps us to halt rebasing. To continue from here use <code>git rebase --continue</code>. e.g: <code>break</code> (in a single line)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The remaining three commands are usually used together to replay merge commits. The commands are:</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>label</strong> - this command helps us to provide an alternate name to the current HEAD.</li>\n<li><strong>reset</strong> - this command helps us to reset current HEAD to the given label.</li>\n<li><strong>merge</strong> - this command helps us to create a merge commit, if an original merge commit is provided, its message will be used otherwise we can provide a new one after '#'</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here in this example, I’ll be using these commands to create a pseudo-merge commit from the linear git history (shown in the above figure) </p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">pick 9fadd5a add A\nlabel onto\n\npick b390979 add B\npick 97fabfa add C\nlabel main\n\nreset onto\npick 4ecb083 add D\npick a9f32a0 add E\nlabel sub\n\nreset main\nmerge sub # This is new merge commit\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we are labeling commits A, C &amp; E as ‘onto’, ‘main’ and ‘sub’ respectively. Final result will be as below. You can find another great read <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/61103385/1520750\">here</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/04_06.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" />\n<em>Fig-06</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"gitbisect\">Git Bisect</h2>\n<p>This is another git command with a bunch of sub commands. It helps to find the commit that introduced a bug/change by <strong>binary search</strong>. First you need to mark at least two commits as good and bad respectively, so that git can do the binary search.\neg: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git bisect start\ngit bisect bad 4ecb083\ngit bisect good 97fabfa\n</code></pre>\n<p>Short hand for the above is <code>git bisect start [bad commit] [good commit]</code></p>\n<pre><code>git bisect start 4ecb083 97fabfa\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once done git will pick a commit in between good and bad and ask us whether it is either good or bad. We need to check and mark appropriately. To mark good run the command <code>git bisect good</code> otherwise <code>git bisect bad</code>. This process continues until git finds the first bad commit. To reset back to previous state run <code>git bisect reset</code>, if you want to switch to a specific commit run <code>git bisect reset commithash</code>. To go back to bad commit when bisect is completed, use the command <code>git bisect reset bisect/bad</code>. ‘bisect/bad’ is a single option and should be used together. I used it as <code>git bisect reset bad</code> the first time and got error. 😃</p>\n<p>But don’t you find this bit boring? Can we automate this? 🤔</p>\n<p>Of course yes! If you have an external test script you can run it as below. One catch is that your tests and test script should be in an external path or untracked in the current repository.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git bisect start $badCommit $goodCommit\ngit bisect run $testScript\ngit bisect reset # go back to previous state after bisect\n</code></pre>\n<p>An example power-shell script to run dotnet tests is given below.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ps language-ps\"> param (\n    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n    [string]$goodCommit = $( Read-Host \"Good commit hash, please\" ),\n    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n    [string]$badCommit = $( Read-Host \"Bad commit hash, please\" ),\n    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n    [string]$testProjectPath = $( Read-Host \"Test project path, please\" )\n )\n Write-Host $goodCommit $badCommit $testProjectPath \n try \n {\n   git bisect start $badCommit $goodCommit\n   git bisect run dotnet test $testProjectPath -v q\n   git bisect reset\n }\n catch {\n    write-host \"Caught an exception:\" -ForegroundColor Red\n    write-host \"Exception Type: $($_.Exception.GetType().FullName)\" -ForegroundColor Red\n    write-host \"Exception Message: $($_.Exception.Message)\" -ForegroundColor Red\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you discover that you made a mistake in specifying the status of a revision, you can save the output of <code>git bisect log</code> to a file. Edit it to remove the incorrect entries, and then issue the following commands to return to a corrected state.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git bisect log &gt; log-file\ngit bisect reset\ngit bisect replay log-file\n</code></pre>\n<p>Woof, That's some long read.</p>",

In the Web.config file we need to add few key-value pairs. Here you need to provide your master account’s username and password.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/01_02.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/fdec1fe979dd353cd04bb86474e387e3</em></p>\n<p>You’ll get ‘applicationId’, ‘workspaceId’ and ‘reportId’ during Power BI setup. Now we need to define the token objects to be returned from the methods.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/01_03.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Token object for Dashboard/Reports. Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/5e56889f072a2606c1da0646766501dc</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/01_04.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Token object for Tiles. Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/8d4960b06aeefa218886c959308974f6</em></p>\n<p>We need to add Microsoft Power BI client <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerBI.Api/\">library</a> as we are invoking Power BI API’s from the server side code.</p>\n<p>As API methods, I’ve created three methods for Reports, Dashboards and Tiles respectively.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>GetReportEmbedToken</strong>— This method accepts two optional parameters, username and roles, which is used for enabling row-level security (RLS). You can find more info about RLS <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-admin-rls\">here</a>. In the method, we are returning the embed token for the first report available in the workspace.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>GetDashboardEmbedToken</strong>— This method returns the embed token for the first dashboard in the workspace.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>GetTileEmbedToken</strong>— This method returns the embed token for the first tile in the first dashboard which is available in the workspace.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/01_05.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>API method for getting embed token. Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/b093ab817d8fc29e4096346e034ccf3f</em></p>\n<p>You can extend this methods to return tokens for custom reports, dashboards and tiles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"createangularclient\">Create Angular client</h3>\n<p>Here we need to create a service to call the API we created above. For that, let’s create a service and add the following method.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/01_06.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/2387fa2a7fb2746cf1b0d93c149f03a9</em></p>\n<p>In the HTML page, create a ‘div’ with id ‘embedReport’. We’ll be showing report in this div. Embedding in div is done using Power BI JavaScript <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript\">library</a>. You can add it to your angular application by running the following command.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --save powerbi-client\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we need to create a method in component class to embed the reports as follows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/01_07.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Gist: https://gist.github.com/krishnaanaril/412001afccf2f74d1c840e1f7fb4b7fe</em></p>\n<p>For embedding reports for customers, type should be ‘reports’ and token type should be ‘Embed’. Here you can see the code for ‘tokenExpirationListener’. This is added as the generated tokens are valid only for an hour and it expires after that. So we need to generate another token by that time and update it. More info can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript/wiki/Refresh-token-using-JavaScript-SDK-example\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Now you’re done with your Angular app and its corresponding Web API, run it and verify the reports.</p>",
