# What did I learn this week (2021) - 01

Since this is the first and shortest week of the year, I don't have much items here.

1. Learned about the '[zoom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/zoom)' property in css. This helps to set the zoom level for a particular html element. It is an experimental property and not all browsers support it, especially Firefox.

2. I found a [tailwind starter kit](https://tailwind-starter-kit.now.sh) site which helps to bootstrap components easily. 

3. Atomic clocks used in satellites must be sent time updates twice per day to correct the clock's natural drift. I found this when I was googling to find the plausibility of time travelling. This information is mentioned in the [NASA site](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/what-is-an-atomic-clock).
